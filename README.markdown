ddcli is an Objective-C library to help write command line applications by simplifying parsing command line options and eliminating much of the boiler plate code. The `getopt_long(3)` function is used to parse command options, but the complexity of using this function is hidden by an Objective-C wrapper (DDGetoptLongParser). Key-Value Coding (KVC) is used to set the options on a target class.
